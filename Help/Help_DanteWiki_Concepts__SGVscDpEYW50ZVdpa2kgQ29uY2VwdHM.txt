==== Perpetual Beta ====
Perpetual beta is a general concept of web 2.0 in which a service is never considered
complete or finished but permanently is in a preliminary or draft (i.e. beta) status.
This is inevitable in many web 2.0 services, as only during the construction of the system
a better understanding of the requirements emerges.


==== Bootstrapped Development ====
Bootstrapped development is common in open knowledge management systems. The system itself is
used for documenting the work with the system, as it is done on this page. Throughout this
process the users and developers learn about their knowledge management needs.

==== User Co-Development ====
The system is not developed by IT architects for users but by a user for the needs of the
users. Thus, the developers are typical representatives of the user community, which
avoids the usual distance between developers and users.
