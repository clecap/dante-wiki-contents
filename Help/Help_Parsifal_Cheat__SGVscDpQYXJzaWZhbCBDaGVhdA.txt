==== Collapse ====

==== Continuation ====
Situation: We want to split TeX text into several smaller portions.
Advantages of this are:
* Faster preview
* Smaller unit of error and unit of editing
* Seperate edit link

For the presentation, there can be several scenarios:
* Separation: We want a bit of markup which lets the reader see that there are two
different portions of text. 
* Continuation: We do not want to indicate this separation into two different portions of text. The second portion should be a seamless continuation of the
first text. Nevertheless there should be a possibility for the reader to recognize the two parts and to invoke edit links and similar actions for the
two parts.
