say that the object is (or is in the state) $\omega$ as this description might not be precise enough in the sense that the object
might have additional properties as well (The color red is an insufficient characterization of an object). We have the fantasy that
a sufficient number of properties will uniquely describe an object (This fantasy might not be true).
We used language to assign the property to the object but we should rather have used language which assigns the property to the 
relation of both, the measurement device and the object. And we should not ignore that, in addition to measurement device and object there is
also a certain rest in the universe. In the end, we should talk about the property being connected to the measurement device, the object and the rest of the universe. However, it is more convenient, at least in the beginning, to assume that the property belongs to the object 
alone and take the journey from there. Also,lkj  we must admit that there are observations (Hon Mandel dip) and theories (particle number operator not always
precisely defined in Fock space) which make it difficult to talk about well-defined objects, of which we have the fantasy that they can be identified, and even if they do not carry identity that the at least could be counted in numbers of a kind.

We make the observation: If we measure a property twice immediately after each other leaving no time for development in between,
we get the same result. This might not be the case for every measurement (there are measuremetns for which this is not true and where we describe the measurement as an interaction which changes the object in a way and
there are measurements which cannot be made twice in a row as, for example, they destroy the measured object by the very act of observation -- at least
that is how we describe the situations in these cases), but at least we can assume this for a class of ideal measurements. 

Under this assumption: After the measurement we talk about the property of the object in a precise manner in the sense
that a repeated measurement leads to the same result.

So, how would we describe the object before the measurement?

Assume we make the observation, that an object may lead to different measurement results. 
We find: When we measure (different) objects of a certain kind of which we believe we know no difference (short of knowing somehow that they are different), why would they lead to different measurement results.

a
Even worse: We assumed that we knew a property after the measurement. So we know the object as such. 

We can describe this as: One property is still missing which we did not measure in that measurement (for example we measured color and not smell) and if we had measured it
we would have realized that the object is indeed different.
We can describe this as: Before the measurement the object did not have the property we measured (it was imprinted by the measurement).
Before the measurement the object had that property only to a certain degree, and for some reason the measurement process selected this and not that aspect of the property.
