=== Why is this called DanteWiki? ===
The thought of writing done what one has understood dates
back to Dante:

"O mente, che scrivesti ciò ch’io vidi" (Dante, Inferno II, 8)

"O Gedächtnis, das geschrieben, was ich erkannte" (own translation)

This thought has also been described in a letter of 
Nicolo Machiavelli to Francesco Vettori, florentinian
ambassador in Rome. 
We cite it here according to Niccolo Machiavelli, Der Fürst. 
Suhrkamp Verlag, 2016:

<poem>
Und weil Dante sagt, es gebe keine Wissenschaft ohne die Aufzeichnung dessen,
was man begriffen hat – so habe ich das notiert, was ich bei dem Gespräch
mit Ihnen als das Wesentliche festhielt, und ein kleines Werk über Fürstentümer
verfaßt, worin ich mich so weit wie möglich in die Gedanken über dieses Thema
vertiefe und erörtere, was Herrschaft ist, welche Arten es davon gib, wie man sie
erwirbt und erhält und warum man sie verliert.
</poem>

Or, for short:

"[E]s [gibt] keine Wissenschaft ohne die Aufzeichnung dessen, was
man begriffen hat."

"There is no science without a record of what one has understood" (own translation)

That's why I call this Wiki system a DanteWiki.

=== What does the logo show? ===
The logo shows a painting made 
by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio in 1607. It depicts Saint Jerome
of Stridon, who is best known for his translations of the Bible into Latin. 
it here serves as the symbol of a scientist, philosopher and thinker.
Saint Jerome is alone, remote from the distractions of the world,
focused alone on putting down his thoughts.
The skull on his table reminds us of the mortality of man and the
volatility of his thoughts.
It thus challenges us to write down our thoughts.

The logo thus reflexts my core motives when creating this system.

=== What is the relation to MediaWiki? ===
None.

I did not want to build this system completely from scratch.
MediaWiki was the software which contained most of the necessary 
base functionality and was open for further development 
due to its open license model.
I will try to keep DanteWiki as close to MediaWiki as possible
to ease maintenence and bug fixing.

=== What is the relation to WikiPedia? ===
None.

While WikiPedia is a very interesting project, I do not
subscribe to the objectivist perspective on which it seems
to be grounded. In particular - in my opinion - 
the neutral point of view goal of WikiPedia cannot be achieved
for a number of linguistic reasons and should not
be aimed for due to a number of philosophic reasons.

DanteWiki follows different goals and guidelines.
